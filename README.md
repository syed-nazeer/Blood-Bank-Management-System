Analysis of Our Blood Bank Management System:-<br/>
● An efficient blood bank database would aim to easily connect potential donors with blood-banks, blood-banks with potential recipients and vice versa.<br/>
● The potential donors would be connected with their nearest blood bank.<br/>
● Another Objective of the database is to register and store blood-banks by their location in order for them to be connected to potential donors and recipients
with ease.<br/>
● The blood banks aim to receive and give out blood from people in need (recipients) closest to them.<br/>
● The blood recipient would need to be connected to a bank which possesses his blood in the closest proximity to him.<br/>
